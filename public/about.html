<h1>About Me</h1>

<hr />

<p>Hey there! I’m a tech enthusiast and a movie buff who loves exploring both the digital world and the world of cinema. 
By profession, I work as a Quality Assurance Engineer, ensuring things run smoothly in the software space. But beyond that, 
I have a deep passion for movies—I enjoy watching, analyzing, and sharing my thoughts on them.</p>

<p>I’m currently building a movie review website where I’ll be posting my ratings and reviews of all the films I watch. 
  From timeless classics to the latest releases, I love diving into different genres and storytelling styles.</p>

<p>When I’m not watching movies, you’ll probably find me on the football field or passionately supporting Arsenal. 
  But that’s just a part of who I am—there’s so much more to my world, and I’m always exploring new interests and experiences.</p> 

<p>To know more about me and everything I’m passionate about, keep following my website-there’s always something new to discover! </p>
